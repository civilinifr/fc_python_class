    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)**: A hardware component specializing in the operations required to display an image. Not necessary for typical use, but important for video editing and computer games. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD) /Solid State Drive (SSD)**: Where data is *permamentely* saved on the computer. Can either be a hard drive, where data is saved by a magnetic strip, or solid state, where information is saved on semiconductor cells. Solid state hard drives are much faster, take less power, and are more resistant do damage. Brain analogy - Long term memory storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Where data is *temporarily* saved on the computer. This is wiped clean every time you restart the computer. Extremely important hardware, because it takes the output from certain components to input as other components. If your computer is \"slow\", it may mean that your ram is insufficient for all the operations that you're trying to do. Some companies (*cough Apple cough cough*) will update their programs to use more and more RAM even though they don't need to, trying to force the consumer to buy a new computer out of frustration. Brain analogy - Short term memory. \n",

    "\n",
    "All information in all machine components is represented as **bits**, which are binary storages of information. Each bit can be thought of as a switch with two possible positions: on (current passing through) or off (no current passing through). This binary logic of 1s and 0s is what all computer operations are running through. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is only so much we can do with a single bit (basically a true or false statement). Instead, most information is placed as **bytes**, which is 8 bits grouped together. Each byte can give us $2^8$ possibile configurations, or 256 numbers. In computer science we start with an index of 0, so a byte gives us numbers from 0 to 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean in practice? Let's take text as an example. *ASCII* is an encoding typically used for the English language (i.e., displays text). In ASCII, the letter **\"A\"** is represented by a combination of **\"0100 0001\"**, or a byte where the 1st and 7th bites (read from right to left) are activated. Another example could be the number **7**, which is represented by **\"0011 0111\"**. \n",

    "## High-level vs low-level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program reads input (from your keyboard or stored file) into RAM, uses the CPU to conduct an operation, and outputs the result to RAM. Every input and output is represented as bits. However, human brains aren't really good at operating in binary in chunks of 8. Fortunately, we don't have to, because smart people wrote programs to interpret bytes (and groups of bytes) into readable formats. For example, when I want to write the letter **A** in a program, I can just hit the letter on my keyboard and it is interpreted in binary in the RAM and CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When someone refers to a \"low-level\" instruction, it means that it is close to binary or machine language (i.e. bits and bytes). The aforementioned binary to ASCII code would be an example of a very low-level operation. A high level operation, instead, would be something like saving a text file using microsoft word. In this example, all machine language is hidden from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages can vary on the low-level to high-level spectrum. Computer scientists lean towards low-level languages like C, which allow the user to create very-fast and extremely customizable programs, at the expense of code complexity. Scientists, on the other hand, lean towards high-level languages such as Matlab, which are more limited and comparitively slower, but are easier to interpret, highly repeatable, and are still very accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is sort of the best of both worlds. It is a high-level language which can be customized for lower-level operations if need be. \n"

    "Operations in Python operate on groups of code called **packages** which are separate from the main Python installation. For example, a package called **NumPy** is used to store data as vectors or matrices. Another, called **Matplotlib**, is used to make plots. A typical Python code will use lots of these packages. However, as these Python packages are independent from one another, they won't necessarily always play well together. One package will update and sometimes break another. \n",
    "\n",
    "A workaround for this problem is to create something called an **environment**. An environment is an independent grouping of packages that user will create for a particular project. For example, when I start a new project I will create a new environment for that project and use install the needed packages. This means that I'll still be able to go back and run a code from 5 years ago, which used a different combination of packages. An analogy is to think of an environment as a zoo, and the various packages as animals. If you combined together lions and zebras, for example, the zoo may not be super successful....\n",

The reason is that in programming, spaces mean the end of a command or input.

Just don't use spaces and save yourself the headache. \n",

You can also use the same commands for multiple packages in a row, such as  `pip install <packagename1> <packagename2>`.
